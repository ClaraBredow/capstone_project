# CropIT - capstone project

------

### The Project

Sugar and weather make everything better: a climate-based crop recommendation.

A regional recommendation tool for sugar beet cultivar planting.

Enter regional weather data and find out which genetic combination of your sugar beet will result in the highest sugar yield.

------

### The Data

Our anonymous stakeholder kindly provided us with genetic background and sugar yield information for 1205 sugar beet cultivars.

Additionally, we were provided with detailed weather information from company-owned field-stations as well as from Openweather stations closest to the fields.

1. 'df_sugarbeet'
2. 'df_weatherstations'
3. 'df_openweather'
4. 'df_locations'

'df_sugarbeet': 1205 sugar beet cultivars on 15 fields, their sugar content and genetic background.

'df_weatherstations': hourly information of weather parameters on 15 fields for 2021.

'df_openweather': hourly information of weather parameters on the closest OpenWeather stations.

'df_locations': field locations and sowing/harvesting dates for 2021.
